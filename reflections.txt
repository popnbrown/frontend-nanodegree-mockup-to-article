You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  I learned the superscript and strikethrough tags. I thought they could only be done through CSS but I saw they were through html.
  * What has been easy?
  All of the bolding and italicizing, because they're distinct.
  * What has been difficult?
  Initially I was trying to use break tags, but realized that using paragraph tags were easier.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  Using lots of trial and error, and making sure I'm being logical and methodical
